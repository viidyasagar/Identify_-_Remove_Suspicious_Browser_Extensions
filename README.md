### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Research on Malicious Extension Behaviors

Malicious browser extensions can pose significant security and privacy risks. Some known risks include:

| Threat               | Description                                               |

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation of Actions Taken

A log file was created to maintain records of extensions removed and actions taken.

#### Example Log File:

```bash
# File: extension_cleanup_log.txt
Date: 2025-07-03

Removed Extension: "Dark PDF Converter"
Reason: Unknown publisher, requested clipboard and tab access
Action: Removed via Firefox Manager, browser restarted, no issues observed.

Removed Extension: "SuperSearch Enhancer"
Reason: Suspicious permissions and poor reviews
Action: Removed, confirmed performance improvement.
```

To create the log:

```bash
nano extension_cleanup_log.txt
```

Use `Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X` to save and exit.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

* Unnecessary and suspicious extensions successfully removed.
* Browser performance improved with faster load time and reduced lag.
* Better understanding of extension permissions and potential security threats.
* Clean documentation and audit log maintained.

---

## üìé Future Recommendations

* Perform regular audits of browser extensions.
* Avoid installing extensions from unknown or unverified developers.
* Keep browsers and extensions up to date.
* Use sandbox environments to test new extensions before deploying on production systems.
